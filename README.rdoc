== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running, but for now, I don't give a fuck.

However, what this app should work like one day is:

1) You log in and select your favorite TV shows

2) You will see calendar with new episodes marked

3) You'll get "new episode aired" email alert in an interval you set

4) ...

5) Profit
